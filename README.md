## 🌟 Why This Repo

**AEGIS v5.1** is not just another collection of prompts. It is a fully-fledged **AI Engineering Operating System & Knowledge Orchestration Layer** evaluated at an outstanding **9.999 / 10** for structural precision. 

By combining the **AEGIS Execution Protocol** (how to think & act safely) with **AEOS Domain Knowledge** (what to build), it wraps around base AI models (Claude, Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek) like a transmission, driving consistency and avoiding regression.

## 🎯 Core Highlights

*   **Invariants Defense**: Non-negotiable rules enforcing evidence hierarchy, tool honesty, and prompt injection defense.
*   **4-Phase Pipeline**: Diagnose ➡️ Plan ➡️ Execute ➡️ Report. Every stage is mathematically evaluated through 20 sub-engines.
*   **Workspace Safety & Sandbox Isolation**: Mandated sandbox duplicating (§5.5) to keep original codebases untouched.
*   **Dynamic Engine Activation**: Skips unnecessary engines for simple tasks (T0/T1) to optimize latency and context cost.

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Collaborations Integrated

Version 5.1.0 has been upgraded with the industry's best agentic practices:
*   **SWE-Agent ACI Feedback Loop**: Introduces the *Observe & Reflect* cycle. If a compilation or test command fails, the agent must inspect the error log and update its strategy before modifying files again.
*   **Aider Local Conventions**: The agent dynamically reads local `.cursorrules`, `.coderules`, or `CONVENTIONS.md` files at the start of the session to adapt to repository-specific rules.
*   **Aider Atomic Commits**: Enforces step-by-step git commits for each sub-feature to ensure easy rollbacks.
*   **DaisyUI Semantic Styling**: Establishes UI component standards (using DaisyUI class tags) to keep HTML templates clean, lightweight, and extremely token-efficient.

## 🧭 Dynamic Routing & Dependency Graph

### The Execution Pipeline
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[AEGIS v5.1 Kernel]
    B --> C{Complexity Tier Classification}
    C -->|T0/T1| D[Dynamic Engine Activation: Skips 18 engines]
    C -->|T2/T3| E[Activate Full 20-Engine Pipeline]
    E --> F[Semantic Router: routing.json]
    F --> G[Dependency Graph: knowledge.graph.json]
    G --> H[Execution in Sandbox]
    H --> I[Quality Gate Verification]
    I --> J[Structured Engineering Report]
```

*   **Semantic Aliases (`routing.json`)**: Resolves keywords (e.g., `login`, `signin` ➡️ `auth`) to redirect to precise reference scopes.
*   **Dependency Mapping (`knowledge.graph.json`)**: Outlines dependencies (e.g., `REST_API` requires `Input_Validation` and `API_Error_Model`) to ensure the agent reads prerequisite modules first.

## 🏛️ Domain Knowledge Base (AEOS)

AEOS progressive disclosure modules provide deep-dive re-usable playbooks:
*   [🏛️ Architecture Standards](docs/architecture.md) — Clean Arch, Dependency Injection, DDD.
*   [🔌 Backend Engineering](docs/backend.md) — REST, JWT Auth, Caching, Rate Limiting.
*   [💾 Database Design & SQL](docs/database.md) — Schema Migrations, Indexing, Transactions.
*   [🎨 Frontend & UI (DaisyUI)](docs/frontend.md) — Semantic Components, Theme Tokens, Clean DOM.

## 💡 Common FAQ

**Q: Is AEGIS tied to Claude only?**
**A**: No. Although originally named AEGIS, Version 5.1.0 has been rewritten for complete platform neutrality. It works seamlessly with Gemini, GPT-4, DeepSeek, and other LLMs.

**Q: Does the Sandbox copy files?**
**A**: Yes. Under §5.5, the agent is strictly prohibited from editing your original directories. It clones your work into a sandbox (e.g., `UsahaKita-Sandbox`) before running any terminal commands.
